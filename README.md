# Burmese-Topic-Modeling
Burmese Topic Modeling with BERTopic

This repository contains a Python notebook file for training Burmese topic modeling using BERTopic. BERTopic is an open-source topic modeling technique that leverages the power of BERT embeddings to identify and cluster topics in a given text corpus. Accompanying the Python notebook is a dataset containing 30,000 word-break sentences in the Burmese language. This dataset serves as the input corpus for the topic modeling process.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Burmese topic modeling project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Burmese-Topic-Modeling.git
``` 
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook file (burmese_topic_modeling.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This notebook contains the code for training the Burmese topic modeling using BERTopic.

3. Make sure you have the necessary data for training. Update the notebook with the appropriate paths or modify the data loading code to match your dataset.

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the Burmese topic model using BERTopic. +

Once the training is complete, you can explore the generated topics and their corresponding documents. You can also modify the parameters and experiment with different configurations to optimize the topic modeling results.
